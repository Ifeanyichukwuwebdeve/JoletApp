                  PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES
                  (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO
                  NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS
                  THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Welcome to Career Move. Please read on to learn the rules and
                  restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products,
                  services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any
                  questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the
                  Services, please contact us at team@careermove.io
                </p>
                <p>
                  These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract
                  between you and Career Move (“Career Move,” “we”, and “us”).
                  You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t
                  have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in
                  any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these
                  Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These
                  Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as
                  those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy.
                </p>
                <h4>Will these Terms ever change?</h4>
                <p>
                  We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these
                  Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve
                  the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we
                  will bring it to your attention by updating the terms on the
                  Career Move website, by sending you an email, and/or by some
                  other means.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject
                  them, however it means you will no longer be able to use the
                  Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to
                  the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the
                  changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment
                  or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in
                  writing and signed by both you and us.

                </p>
                <p>
                  You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a
                  password and username. You agree to provide us with accurate,
                  complete, and up-to-date registration information about
                  yourself. You may not select as your username a name that you
                  don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the
                  intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your
                  account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal
                  age to form a binding contract, or if not, you’ve received
                  your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and
                  gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your
                  behalf.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You will only use the Services for your own internal,
                  personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the
                  benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies
                  with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services
                  is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized
                  to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for
                  your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You will not share your account or password with anyone, and
                  you must protect the security of your account and your
                  password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with
                  your account.

                  You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
                  (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like
                  Career Move, being asked to remove material that allegedly
                  violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual
                  property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable
                  Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the
                  accounts of repeat alleged infringers.:

                  <strong>Will Career Move ever change the Services?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may
                  change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of
                  the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose
                  limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all
                  of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a
                  material change to the Services that would adversely affect
                  you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve
                  the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time,
                  for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone
                  alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these
                  Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Does Career Move ever cost anything?</strong></p>
                <p>
                  Some of the services on Career Move are free and some are
                  paid. We will notify you before any Services you are using
                  begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such
                  Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.

                  You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at
                  team@careermove.io; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as
                  well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat
                  information you provide to us after you have stopped using our
                  Services. Career Move ever is also free to terminate (or
                  suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account,
                  for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of
                  these Terms. Career Move ever has the sole right to decide
                  whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set
                  forth in these Terms
                </p>
                <p>
                  Account termination may result in destruction of any Content
                  associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you
                  decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide
                  advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so
                  that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions
                  you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by
                  law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it
                  would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of
                  someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the
                  rights or property of Career Move.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination
                  of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example,
                  all of the following will survive termination: any obligation
                  you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our
                  liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual
                  property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.
